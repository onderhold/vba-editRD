**onderhold**: how can I set up automated testing in this project? Are there alredy some provisions in place? (I am new to this code and Python in general.)

**GitHub Copilot**: Great question! Looking at your project, there are already excellent testing provisions in place. Let me walk you through what's already set up and how to use it.

## What's Already Set Up

### 1. **Pytest Framework**

The project uses pytest as the testing framework, which is already configured in pyproject.toml:

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
minversion = "7.0"
addopts = "-ra -q --strict-markers --strict-config"
testpaths = ["tests"]
markers = [
    "slow: marks tests as slow",
    "integration: marks tests as integration tests",
    "unit: marks tests as unit tests",
]
```

### 2. **Test Files**

There are comprehensive test files already written:

- test_office_vba.py - Tests for VBA handling
- test_utils.py - Tests for utility functions
- conftest.py - Pytest configuration

### 3. **GitHub Actions CI/CD**

Automated testing runs on GitHub via `test.yaml`:

- Tests on Windows (required for Office COM)
- Tests Python versions 3.9-3.13
- Runs on every push/PR to `dev` branch

### 4. **Coverage Reporting**

Coverage tracking is configured in pyproject.toml:

```toml
[tool.coverage.run]
source = ["src"]
[tool.coverage.report]
exclude_lines = ["pragma: no cover", ...]
```

## How to Run Tests

### **Local Testing** (recommended for development):

```bash
# Install in development mode (if not done yet)
pip install -e .[dev]

# Run all unit tests (excludes integration tests)
pytest -m "not integration"

# Run all tests with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_office_vba.py -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run only fast tests (exclude slow ones)
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run tests with VBA trust access check
pytest --check-vba-trust

# Test only Excel
pytest tests/test_cli.py --apps excel -v

# Single test case for Excel, e.g. config file handling
pytest tests/cli/test_config.py::TestCLIConfig::test_config_file_with_real_document --apps excel -v

# Test Excel and Word
pytest tests/test_cli.py --apps excel,word -v

# Test only Word
pytest tests/test_cli.py --apps word -v

# Test all available apps (default)
pytest tests/test_cli.py --apps all -v
pytest tests/test_cli.py -v  # same as above

# Test with specific markers
pytest tests/test_cli.py --apps excel -m "office and not integration" -v

# Test Excel-specific functionality
pytest tests/test_excel_vba_cli.py --apps excel -v

# Test only integration tests for Word
pytest tests/test_cli.py --apps word -m integration -v
```

### **View Coverage Report**:

After running with `--cov-report=html`, open `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser.

## Test Categories

The project uses test markers to organize tests:

- **Unit tests**: Fast tests that don't require Office COM
- **Integration tests**: Tests that interact with actual Office applications
- **Slow tests**: Tests that take longer to run

## Recommended Development Workflow

1. **Make your changes** (Rubberduck folders + watchfiles)

2. **Run tests locally**:

   ```bash
   pytest -m "not integration" -v
   ```

3. **Check coverage**:

   ```bash
   pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html -m "not integration"
   ```

4. **Add new tests** for your features

5. **Run full test suite**:

   ```bash
   pytest -v
   ```

6. **Push to GitHub** - CI will run automatically

## Important Notes

- **Windows Required**: Many tests require Windows + Office COM, so local testing on Windows is important
- **COM Tests**: Some tests are marked with `@pytest.mark.com` and require COM initialization
- **Mock Testing**: The project uses extensive mocking (see `BaseOfficeMock`) to test without requiring actual Office installations

The testing infrastructure is very well set up! You can focus on writing your features and adding corresponding tests. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically validate everything when you push your changes.
